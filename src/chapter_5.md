# Network Topologies

Network topologies refer to the physical and logical arrangement of devices in a computer network. The following are common types of network topologies:

1. Star: Devices are connected to a central hub or switch, with each device having a dedicated point-to-point connection to the central device.

2. Bus: Devices are connected to a single cable or backbone that runs through the network, with each device tapping into the cable to receive and transmit data.

3. Ring: Devices are connected in a circular arrangement, with data being transmitted in one direction around the ring.

4. Mesh: Each device has a dedicated point-to-point connection to every other device in the network.

5. Tree: A hybrid of the star and bus topologies, with a central root node connected to multiple branches or sub-networks.

# P2P and Servers

Peer-to-peer (P2P) topology is a type of network where each device has equal responsibility for processing data, and can act as both a client and a server. Devices are connected directly to each other, without the need for a central server or hub.

Client-server topology, on the other hand, is a type of network where one device acts as a central server, and the other devices are clients that request services or resources from the server. The server is responsible for managing and distributing data and resources to clients, while the clients are responsible for sending requests and receiving data from the server.

Each topology has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of topology depends on the specific requirements of the network, such as network size, the number of devices, and the required level of network availability.
