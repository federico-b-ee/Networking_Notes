# Telnet vs SSH

Telnet and SSH are both communication protocols used to manage and access remote devices over a network. However, there are some key differences between the two:

> Security: Telnet transmits data in clear text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering, while SSH encrypts all data.
> 
> Authentication: Telnet requires a username and password for authentication, while SSH supports a more secure public key-based authentication.
>
> Port number: Telnet uses port number 23, while SSH uses port number 22.
>
> Functionality: Telnet is limited to text-based interactions, while SSH provides secure terminal access and also supports file transfers, X11 forwarding, and port forwarding.

In general, SSH is preferred over Telnet for remote device management and access due to its enhanced security and functionality.
