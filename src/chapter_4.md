# Cabling

RJ45 (Commonly used) is a type of connector commonly used for Ethernet cables. TIA-568A and TIA-568B are two standards for wiring Ethernet cables using an RJ45 connector.

The main difference between TIA-568A and TIA-568B is the order of the wire colors. In TIA-568A, the order is green, green/white, orange, blue, blue/white, orange/white, brown, and brown/white. In TIA-568B, the order is green, green/white, orange, blue/white, blue, orange/white, brown/white, and brown.

Both TIA-568A and TIA-568B are commonly used, and there is no significant performance difference between the two. The choice of which standard to use is typically based on the existing cabling infrastructure or personal preference.

> NOTE:
> 
> It is important to use the same wiring standard for both ends of the cable, as different wiring standards can result in incorrect connections or reduced performance.

The cables are known as twisted pair, they can be shielded and the used categories are Cat5, 5e, 6, 6a


# Coaxial and Fiber Optic Cable

## Coaxial Cable

> A coaxial cable consists of a single copper core surrounded by insulation, a braided shield, and an outer jacket.
> 
> Coaxial cables are commonly used for cable television (CATV) and broadband internet connections.
> 
> Coaxial cables are capable of transmitting high-frequency signals over long distances with minimal signal loss.

## Fiber Optic Cable

> A fiber optic cable consists of one or more thin glass or plastic fibers surrounded by insulation and a protective outer jacket.
> 
>   Fiber optic cables transmit data signals using light instead of electrical signals.
>
>  Fiber optic cables are capable of transmitting large amounts of data over long distances at high speeds.
>  They are also immune to electromagnetic interference, making them suitable for use in environments with high levels of electrical noise.

### Modes

> Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)
> Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)
