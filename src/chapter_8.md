# DMZ and Port-Forwarding (Personal Web-Server/Hosting)

DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a network security term referring to a dedicated subnet used to isolate internal network resources from direct access from the Internet. Port forwarding is a feature in network routers that allows incoming traffic to be redirected to specific devices on a network, based on the port number specified in the incoming traffic. Port forwarding can be used to expose a service or application hosted on a device in the DMZ to the Internet, allowing remote users to access it.

# Honeypots

A honeypot is a decoy computer system or network that is set up to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts or to prevent attacks. The goal of a honeypot is to distract and divert attackers from critical systems and gather information about their tactics, techniques, and procedures for later analysis. Honeypots are commonly used for research, threat intelligence, and incident response.
