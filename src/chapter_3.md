# Network Types

WAN (Wide Area Network) and LAN (Local Area Network) are two common types of computer networks. They differ in several key characteristics:

WAN Characteristics:

> Large geographic coverage: WANs can span large distances, covering cities, states, or even entire countries.
>
> High-speed connections: WANs typically use high-speed connections, such as leased lines or satellite links, to provide fast and 
>reliable communication between distant locations.
>
> Centralized management: WANs are typically managed by a central IT department or service provider.
>
> Reliance on third-party service providers: WANs often rely on third-party service providers for connectivity and network 
>services.

LAN Characteristics:


> Limited geographic coverage: LANs typically cover a small area, such as a single building or campus.
> 
> High-speed connections: LANs use high-speed connections, such as Ethernet, to provide fast and reliable communication within the local area.
> 
> Decentralized management: LANs are often managed by local IT staff or users.
> 
> Ownership: LANs are typically owned and operated by a single entity, such as a company or an educational institution.

In summary, WANs are characterized by large geographic coverage, high-speed connections, centralized management, and reliance on third-party service providers, while LANs are characterized by limited geographic coverage, high-speed connections, decentralized management, and ownership by a single entity.

# Common Methods for WAN Connections

Leased Lines and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) are two common methods used for WAN (Wide Area Network) connections.

## Leased Lines
Leased lines are dedicated, permanent connections between two points, typically between two offices of a company or between a company and its service provider. The connection is dedicated, meaning that the connection is reserved for exclusive use by the customer and not shared with other users. Leased lines are typically used for mission-critical applications that require a high level of reliability and security. They offer predictable and consistent performance and bandwidth, making them a good choice for applications that require large amounts of data transfer, such as video conferencing or large file transfers.


### (PPP) Point-to-Point Protocol
PPP is a data link protocol used for dial-up or leased line connections. It provides a way for two devices to establish a direct connection over a serial line, such as a telephone line or a leased line. PPP provides support for authentication, error detection and correction, and data compression, making it a flexible and widely-used protocol for remote access and WAN connections. Unlike leased lines, PPP connections are shared, meaning that multiple users can use the same connection at the same time, making it a more cost-effective solution for many small businesses or remote users.

In summary, leased lines provide a dedicated, reliable and secure connection for mission-critical applications, while PPP provides a more flexible and cost-effective solution for remote access and WAN connections.

## Packet Switched Networks
In packet switching, data is divided into small packets and sent individually over the network. Each packet is sent separately and may take a different path to reach its destination, where it is reassembled into the original message. This allows for efficient use of network resources as multiple users can transmit data at the same time without interfering with each other. The most common example of a packet-switched network is the Internet.

## Circuit Switched Networks
In circuit switching, a dedicated communication path is established between the two devices for the entire duration of the transmission. The path remains open for the entire transmission and is reserved for the exclusive use of the two devices. This ensures a consistent level of performance but can lead to wasted resources if the connection is idle. An example of a circuit-switched network is the traditional telephone system.

In summary, packet switching is more efficient in terms of network utilization, as multiple users can share the network resources. Circuit switching provides a dedicated connection, making it a good choice for applications that require consistent and guaranteed performance, such as voice or video calls.
