## Handshake

Stealing the handshake refers to capturing the authentication process that takes place between a client and an access point in a Wi-Fi network. This capture can then be used to crack the encryption and obtain access to the network. This attack is possible by intercepting the authentication process (packets) between the client and access point and using specialized software to crack the encryption key.
