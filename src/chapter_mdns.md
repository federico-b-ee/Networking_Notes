# mDNS

mDNS stands for Multicast Domain Name System. It is a protocol that allows for the resolution of hostnames to IP addresses within a local network, without the need for a centralized domain name server (DNS).

Roughly, a DNS set an alias for an ip address.

With the following command this "alias" can be shown:

```bash
hostname
```

Now instead of using the ip: 192.168.{}.{}; is equivalent to using: "alias".local
